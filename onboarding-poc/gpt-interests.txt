I'm a single mom, trying to raise two boys. One loves little league baseball and the other loves playing the saxophone. They both enjoy the outdoors, and camping with the Boy Scouts. It's hard to juggle work and raising them, so I appreciate any kitchen appliances or tools that help me get stuff done faster.
