I'm a college student majoring in graphic design. I'm always on the lookout for deals on art supplies, especially high-quality drawing tablets and software like Adobe Creative Suite. I also enjoy photography as a hobby, so I'm interested in camera gear and accessories. As a typical student, I'm budget-conscious and appreciate good deals on textbooks, dorm room essentials, and affordable meal prep gadgets. In my downtime, I love binge-watching TV shows, so streaming service discounts are always welcome.
